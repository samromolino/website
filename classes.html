                    In all actuality, there are things I'm proud of and willing to share. <br />
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Like how during my studies at Wayne State I sung with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra multiple times (in the chorus, I'm no where near good enough to be a soloist).<br /><br /></li>
                        <li>I composed some pieces that I really liked, like this setting of the Corpus Christi Chorale text (its generated from my notation software so they're not singing the words).<br /><br /></li>

                        <br />
                        <li>
                            And during my time at OCC I've been developing an Android app to manage your D&D 5<sup>th</sup> edition characters which was a great learning experience as I just threw myself into the deep end.
                        </li>
