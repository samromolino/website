		<h1>About Bassam Michael-Farhat Romolino:</h1>
		<h2>I'll use my whole enitre governemt name I'm <i>not</i> scared.</h2>
		<p>
			My first degree is in Vocal Music Education. However, I discovered soon after graduation that I hate teaching so I'm doing a full heel turn into computer science.<br>
			<br>
			You can check out the classes I'm taking <a href="classes.html">here.</a><br>
			<br>
			Outside of academia and my appearent sado-masochistic approach to school work, some of my personal interests include but are not limited to:<br>
		</p>

		<ul class="main">
			<li class="main">READING:</li>
			<ul class="sub">
				<li>My favorite book from childhood is the <i>House of the Scorpion</i> by Nancy Farmer. It follows Matteo Alacr치n.
				<ul class="sub">
					<li>Matteo, or Matt, is the clone of El Patr칩n, the drug lord ruler of a country called Opium; composed of poppy fields running along the US-Aztl치n (formerly Mexico) border. 
					<li>He is kept a secret from the rest of Opium, until he is seprated from his foster mother and found by relatives of El Patr칩n.</li>
					<li>The story deals a lot in the ethics of cloning as well as the ethics of using cloned body parts.
					<br>
					<br>
				</ul>
				<li>More recently, I enjoyed the <i>Iron Widow</i> by Xiran Jay Zhao. It follows Wu Zetian, a reimgaining of China's only female Emporer. 
				<ul class="sub">
					<li>It takes place in a futuristic China where they are constantly beseiged by the Hunduns (giant aliens) and fight back using Chrysalises (giant mechas made from dead Hunduns and powered by qi).
					<li>Theses Chrysalises are piloted by men who have these "concubine" co-pilots to supply additional qi.
					<li>The Chrysalises are designed to prioritize the life of the male pilots, often killing the female co-pilots.
					<li>Zetian's older sister is conscripted as a concubine but dies before ever being able to co-pilot. This causes Zetian to enact a bloody vengence on the system by infultrating it.<br>
					<br>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li class="main">GAMING:</li>
			<ul class="sub">
				<li>I'm a big fan of Tabletop Games.
					<ul class="sub">
						<li>
							Me and my firends have been playing a lot of Gloomhaven recently, a sort-of dungeon crawling, resource management, deck building game.<br>
							<br>
						<li>
							I'm in four TTRPG (Tabletop Roleplaying) campaigns, two of Dungeons & Dragons 5<sup>th</sup> edition and two of Pathfinder 2<sup>nd</sup> edition. 4 is a lot I don't recommend it.
							<ul class="sub">
								<li>I've got some fun characters I play like Raum Einherjar, an Owlin (like an owl person) Barbarian who's a disgraced noble and Gin Ealze, a Kevin McAllister-esque paranoid Kobold (like a small lizard/ dragon person) Gunslinger (pictured below).
									<table class="img">
										<tr>
											<td class="img"><img src="./Raum.png" title="Raum" alt="Raum.png" width="180px" height="315px" /></td>
											<td class="img"><img src="./Gin.png" title="Gin" alt="Gin.png" width="200px" height="250px" /></td>
										</tr>
									</table>
							</ul>
					</ul>

				<li>I've also been playing a lot of co-op video Games
				<ul class="sub">
					<li>Helldivers 2 is an increibly funny 3<sup>rd</sup> person shooter where you fight for Super Earth and spread "Managed Democracy" against the evil forces of the "fascist" bugs, the Terminids, and the "communist" robots, the Automatons.
					<li>Content Warning is a game thats very inspired by Lethal Company, although instead of collecting scrap to sell in a dangerous enviroment, you are essentially react Youtubers going into haunted buildings and trying to film monsters that are trying to kill you.
				</ul>

				<li>Also Darkest Dungeon and Darkest Dungeon 2 are the two most disgustingly beautiful games I've ever played, with an incredible sprite work featuring a collection of cosmic and body horror. I cannot sing their praises enough.
